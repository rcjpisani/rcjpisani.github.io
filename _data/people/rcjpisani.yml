about: >
  <p>Hi there!  My name is Robert Pisani, but you can just call me Rob. 
  I'm a software professional and musician from the Greater Toronto Area
  in Canada.  I got my start in software during my time at Sheridan
  College where I studied Software Development and Network Engineering. 
  As part of the internship program, I saw an opportunity to help a local
  not-for-profit organization, the Alliance for Canadian New Music Projects
  (ACNMP).  Together, with the help of my Uncle who was working at IBM as
  my stand-in Project Manager for the internship (thanks Uncle Rick!) we
  were able to gather requirements from the organization's members and
  deliver a new website, and software to manage their syllabus of
  contemporary Canadian music.  Though I still volunteer my services for
  the organization today, I've since gone on to work at several companies
  in various roles from Software Developer, Team Lead, and more recently
  Sr. Manager - Software Engineering.</p>

  <p>When I'm not working, you can usually find me with a guitar in my
  hands either playing, transcribing music, or jamming with some friends. 
  If i'm not making music, I'm probably lifting in my home gym (playing
  guitar between sets, of course), camping, working on side-projects,
  or playing with my cat!</p>
