about:
  - >
    Hi there!  My name is Robert Pisani, but you can just call me Rob.  I'm a software professional and musician from the Greater Toronto Area in Canada.  My general area of focus is the development of back-end systems, specifically scalable cloud solutions, but I've been known to get my hands dirty in the realm of building UIs.  I'm a huge fan of open-source software and systems and have been daily-driving Linux at home for many years now.  Over the years, I've worked in various technical and people-focused roles such as Senior Software Engineer, Team Lead - Software Engineering, and Sr. Manager - Software Engineering.  I'm currently working as a Tech Lead at Symcor - working with many teams in the organization to build a platform for Open Banking.

      When I'm not working, you can usually find me with a guitar in my hands either playing, transcribing music, or jamming with some friends.  If i'm not making music, I'm probably lifting in my home gym (playing guitar between sets, of course), camping, working on side-projects, messing around with home automation, playing video games, or with my cat!
