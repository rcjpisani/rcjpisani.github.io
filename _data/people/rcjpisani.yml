  - >
    Hi there!  My name is Robert Pisani, but you can just call me Rob.  I'm a software professional and musician from the Greater Toronto Area in Canada.  I got my start in software during my time at Sheridan College where I studied Software Development and Network Engineering.  As part of the internship program, I saw an opportunity to help a local not-for-profit.  Together, with the help of my Uncle was at IBM and acting as my stand-in Project Manager for the internship (thanks Uncle Rick!), we were able to gather requirements from the organization's members and deliver a new website, and a system that is used to manage the data related to their core offering.  Though I still volunteer my services for the organization today, I've since gone on to work at several companies in various roles from Software Developer, Team Lead, and more recently Sr. Manager - Software Engineering.

    When I'm not working, you can usually find me with a guitar in my hands either playing, transcribing music, or jamming with some friends.  If i'm not making music, I'm probably lifting in my home gym (playing guitar between sets, of course), camping, working on side-projects, messing around with home automation, or playing with my cat!
